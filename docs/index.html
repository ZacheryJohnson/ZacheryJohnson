                Hi, my name is Zach (he/him). I'm a backend software engineer in video games (currently looking for work - see below!).

                I'm looking for backend software engineering roles, ideally in video games but considering anything that makes people smile. I have experience in all parts of the stack, from frontend to backend to infrastructure to devops. You can <a href="media/ZacheryJohnsonResume.pdf">grab my resume if you're interested</a>.

                I do have some nonnegotiable points:
                <ul>
                    <li>Must allow full-remote OR hybrid in San Diego, CA only (please specify where in San Diego if hybrid)</li>
                    <li>No projects using/building cryptocurrency/blockchain functionality</li>
                    <li>No roles requiring government clearance</li>
                    <li>No layoffs since January 2022 or earlier</li>
                </ul>

                I understand that disqualifies like 90% of the market in 2024, but hey, surprise me.

                If your company meets these criteria, I'd love to get in touch, preferably through <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zach-johnson-5aa8341b4/">LinkedIn</a> (please provide a message if connecting! I prefer my network to remain people I have worked with directly and will not typically accept cold connection requests).
